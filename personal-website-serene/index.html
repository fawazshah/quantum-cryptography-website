  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I am a first year undergraduate studying Joint Mathematics and Computer Science
  at Imperial College London. </p>
  <h3>Experience</h3>
  <p> <b> Plancktime </b>
    <br> <i> Computer Science and Mathematics Author</i>, London | December 2017 - present </br>
    I write articles related to the fields of computer science and mathematics for a free online
    mathematics and physics resource. At the moment, I have written two monthly articles summing
    up significant occurences within these topics.</br>
  </p>
  <p> <b> Imperial College Union </b>
    <br> <i> Pimlico Connections Volunteer Tutor</i>, London | November 2017 - March 2018 </br>
    I teach maths to excelling year 5 and year 6 students at Christ Church primary school.
    This has taught me how to explain a technical or difficult concept so that those who are less
    experienced or not as familiar with the subject can understand it more easily. Working with
    another tutor to create lesson plans has also improved my communication, organisational
    and teamwork skills. </br>
  </p>
  <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
  <p> <b> Programming Languages </b>: Java, Haskell, HTML, CSS
  <br> <b> Tools </b>: IntelliJ IDEA </br></p>
  <h3>Interests</h3>
  <p> Outside of academics, my interests include: pole and aerial, tennis, singing
    and playing the piano.
  </p>
  <p> <b> Pole and Aerial </b>:
    I joined Imperial's Pole and Aerial society in my first term and have since become
    an active participant. I partake in both the beginner pole classes, which are held on campus, and
    the aerial silks and aerial hoop classes, which are taught at our sister studio 'Aerialand'
    in Hammersmith.
    For the upcoming academic year, I will be aerials officer for the society. The role
    involves overseeing the aerial branch of Imperial's Pole and Aerial society as well as
    liasing with our sister studios, ensuring to maintain good relationships. I will also be
    working with the secretary to code a new booking transferal system and class checking system
    as currently the secretary and aerials officer have to manually transfer internal bookings to
    Aerialand's website and manually check when member's classes are running low.
  </p>
  <p> <b> Music </b>:
    I have achieved an ABRSM grade 8 in both (classical) singing and piano. Some of my song covers for popular
    music can be listened to on my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/serenelc">soundcloud</a>.
