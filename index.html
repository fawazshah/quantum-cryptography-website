	  <h3> Qubit (Quantum bit)</h3>
  

	<p> A qubit is an object which can attain a state of quantum superposition between two states, for example:</p>
	<ul> 
	<li> the up and down spin states of an electron </li>
	<li> the two orthogonal polarization states of a photon. </li>
	</ul>

	  <p>The state of a single qubit can be described by a two-dimensional column vector of complex numbers. The two states in which a qubit are measured are known as basis states, where any pair of vectors that are linearly independent could serve as a basis. These two quantum states correspond to the two states of a classical bit, namely 0 and 1. </p>
	  <p>Any quantum state vector can be written as a sum of these basis vectors, where only two out of infinitely many vectors correspond to states of classical bits.</p>

	<h3> Uncertainty Principle </h3>
	<p> Measuring a qubit collapses the quantum state to either one of the two classical states 0 or 1, i.e. the state of the qubit becomes one of the two basis vectors. Hence, a qubit can be thought to represent both states simultaneously.</p>
	<p> One important aspect of the measurement process is that it alters the state of the quantum system: the effect of the measurement is that the new state is exactly the outcome of the measurement. </p>
	<p> Only a qubit which is already in a basis state (like a classical bit) will be left unchanged after the measurement. </p>

	<h3> No-Cloning Theorem  </h3>
	<p>After the measurement, the system is in the measured state. That is, further measurements will always yield the same value. [1.3] </p>
	<p>As we can only extract one bit of information from the state of a qubit, it has been proved to be physically impossible to fully replicate the original qubit.[1.4] </p>

	<h3> Uses in Cryptography </h3>
	<p> Qubits can be used to transfer a key along a quantum communication channel. This key can then be used to encrypt data using a cipher, allowing data to be sent securely along classical channels of communication.</p>

	  <p><b>Entanglement based protocols </b>: The quantum states of multiple separate objects can become linked together in such a way that they must be described by a combined quantum state, not as individual objects (known as entanglement)  and performing a measurement on one object affects the other. [2.1] This property is used to guarantee a secure connection as intercepting either of the entangled pair of objects alters the overall system.</p>
	  <p><b>Prepare and measure protocols:</b> The security of the protocol comes from encoding the information in non-orthogonal states. Quantum indeterminacy means that both of these states cannot be measured without disturbing the original state; this property can be exploited to detect eavesdropping and to determine the amount of information that has been intercepted. </p>

	<h3>BB84 protocol: Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard (1984)</h3>
				
	  <p>This protocol was designed to use photon polarization states to transmit data, but works with any two pairs of conjugate states, e.g. many optical fibre based implementations use phase encoded states. </p>
	  <p>The sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a quantum communication channel (such as an optical fibre or free space) and a public classical channel (broadcast radio or the internet).</p>

<p> </p>
 
	<h4>Step 1 (Generation of photons/key)</h4>
 
	  <p>Alice creates a random bit (0 or 1) and then randomly selects one of two bases (say vertical/	horizontal or diagonal) to transmit it in. She then prepares a photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, as shown below:</p>

	<img class="mx-auto" src= "img/Zay/quantumTable.png"> 

	  <p>The sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a quantum communication channel (such as an optical fibre or free space) and a public classical channel (broadcast radio or the internet).</p>

<p> </p>

	<h4>Step 2 (Quantum transmission of photons/ key)</h4>

	<p>Alice then transmits a single photon in this state to Bob using the quantum channel. This process is repeated with new random bits, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.</p>

<p> </p>

	<h4>Step 3 (Check validity of measurements)</h4>

	<p>As Bob does not know the basis the photons were encoded in, he selects a basis at random to measure in, for example using a horizontal/vertical polarizing filter.</p>
	<p>If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical then this measures the correct state, but if it was created as diagonal then there is a 50-50 chance of returning either horizontal or vertical. Bob also records the time, measurement basis used and measurement result of each photon received.[2.2]</p>
	<p>Bob and Alice then compare the basis in which Alice sent each photon with the basis Bob measured it in, discarding any which do not match to leave on average half the bits as a shared key.</p>

<p> </p>

	<h4>Step 4 (Security/No cloning Theorem)</h4>

	<p>Alice and Bob then compare a predetermined subset of their remaining bit strings, aborting the key and trying again if over a certain number of bits differ,  possibly with a different quantum channel. </p>
	<p>An eavesdropper (Eve) must gain a copy of each photon for themself and pass an accurate copy on to Bob to avoid detection when Alice and Bob compare later. </p>
	<p> However, this is impossible as the no cloning theorem guarantees that if a cloning device can copy the vertical/horizontal polarizations, it will fail to copy either of the diagonal polarizations.[2.3] Hence, to eavesdrop, Eve must introduce errors in Bob’s measurements, and the key will be aborted. </p>

              <p style="text-align: justify">
              Coin flipping was introduced by Manuel Blum in 1981 as part of classical cryptography.
              Coin flipping is used when two parties do not trust each other (and there is not a reliable third party present to prevent cheating). E.g. Bob and Alice are divorced and live in different cities. They flip a coin over the phone to decide who will get the car. However, Bob is worried that if he tells Alice ‘heads’ say, Alice will lie and tell him he lost regardless of what the outcome of the coin flip actually is.
              Classical coin flipping is based on the assumption that completely secure one-way functions (‘an efficiently computable function … whose inverse cannot be computed efficiently’ and ‘from a knowledge of f(x) one cannot have more than a 50-50 change to guess efficiently if x has some non trivial property e.g. is even’ - Blum) exist.
              However, we do not know if they do, so currently we base it off normally secure one way functions/bit commitment schemes such as large prime factorisation which is used in current cryptographic systems (public/private key distribution) or cryptographic hashing.
              A commitment scheme allows you to commit to a chosen value whilst keeping it hidden from the other person. The value cannot be changed after it has been committed, but it can be shown when you desire. (with bit commitment schemes the committed value is a bit).

          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          Method as presented by Blum in his paper [3.1]:
          <ol>
            <li> Alice and Bob agree on a completely secure one way function f. </li>
            <li> Alice selects an integer x unknown to Bob and sends him f(x). </li>
            <li> Bob guesses whether he thinks he is even or odd. </li>
            <li> Alice reveals whether he is wrong or right. She can send him the original x so that Bob can check using the function f whether Alice was lying or not. </li>
          </ol>
          <p style="text-align: justify"> In this way neither can cheat as Bob is just guessing as he cannot determine anything from f(x) and Alice cannot send Bob the wrong number as then when he computes f(the number) it would not produce the number she initially sent Bob in step 2).
            So replace the integer x and the properties even or odd with heads or tails. Alice flips the coin and sends Bob f(coin value). Bob guesses coin value and Alice reveals answer. Bob can check.
          </p>
          One method (from wikipedia):
          <ol>
            <li> Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively. </li>
            <li> Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail". </li>
            <li> Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" </li>
            <li> Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob </li>
            <li> Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"? Bob says, for instance, "heads". </li>
            <li> Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd". </li>
            <li> Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself. Furthermore, Bob by providing his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random string" or "head/random string". </li>
          </ol>
        <h3 style="width: 100%"> Quantum Coin Flipping </h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          Protocol according to wikipedia:
          <ol>
            <li> Alice chooses a random basis e.g. horizontally or diagonally and a random sequence of bits. </li>
            <li> Alice encodes her qubits using her chosen basis and sends these qubits as a sequence of polarized photons to Bob. </li>
            <li> Bob chooses a basis at random for each of the photons and records the reading he gets based on the basis he chose. </li>
            <li> Based on his table, Bob makes a guess as to which basis Alice used to encode the photons. </li>
            <li> Alice can confirm whether Bob was correct or not by sending Bob her original un-encoded sequence along with the basis that she used. Bob can check that Alice has not cheated by comparing his table with a table created from encoding the qubits with Alice’s basis. </li>
