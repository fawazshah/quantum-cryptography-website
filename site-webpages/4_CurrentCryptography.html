  <h2>Implications of Quantum Computing on Current Cryptography</h2>
  <p>Several companies across the world have already built machines capable of quantum computation. A Canadian company,
    D-Wave Systems, became the first company in the world to sell a quantum computer when they announced the D-Wave One,
    a 16-qubit quantum computer, in 2011. Since then they have released multiple iterations of the product, the most
    recent being the D-Wave 2000Q<sup>[4.1]</sup>, containing 2000 qubits. The quantum computer found its first customer
    in Temporal Defense Systems, a cybersecurity firm based in Washington, USA. IBM and Google have also announced
    interest at exploring quantum machinery, with Google having recently announced the Bristlecone<sup>[4.2]</sup>, a
    newly-developed 72-qubit quantum microprocessor. In a blog post they justified it as a proof-of-principle piece of
    technology for building larger quantum computers in the future.</p>

  <p><br>One very significant quantum algorithm, known as Shor’s algorithm, provides a way to factorize large numbers in
    polynomial-time (i.e. fairly quickly) by manipulating the properties of quantum computation. Methods of encryption
    such as RSA and ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) rely on the fact that factorizing large numbers is an
    exponential-time problem (i.e. takes a very long time), so using Shor’s algorithm in practice would completely
    disrupt the RSA system. Pre-Shor’s algorithm methods for factorizing primes take around \(2 ^ {f(n)}\) operations
    (where \(n\) is the ‘modulus’, a specific number used in calculating RSA keys, and \(f(n)\) is some function of
    \(n\)). Shor’s algorithm takes around \((\log n) ^ {f(n)}\) operations, much faster than any other
    process<sup>[4.3]</sup>.</p>
  <p>However, there is still hope. There are several methods of cryptography that, although could be weakened by quantum
    computation in the future, have been categorized as quantum-safe for now. Some of the main ones are the McEliece
    system, lattice-based cryptography, and NTRU (a variant of lattice-based crypto). Other examples include
    multivariate cryptography, symmetric encryptions such as AES, and hash functions like SHA-256.</p>

  </div>
  <p><br>The McEliece system was invented in 1978<sup>[4.4]</sup> by Robert McEliece, a mathematician at Caltech. The
    algorithm uses a structure called a Goppa code, a type of error-correcting linear code, to generate the public key
    and private key. The algorithm proceeds as follows<sup>[4.5]</sup>:</p>

  <div>
    <h2>The McEliece System</h2>
    <div>
      <h3><br>Generating keys</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>The sender, Alice, chooses a binary \((n,k)\)-linear code \(C\) which can correct up to \(t\) errors. This
          code creates a a \( k\times n\) generator matrix \(G\) for the code \(C\), and should also have an efficient
          decoding algorithm.
        </li>
        <li>Alice chooses a random \(k\times k\) binary invertible matrix \(S\), and a random \( n\times n\) permutation
          matrix \(P\).
        </li>
        <li>Alice computes the \(k\times n\) matrix \({\hat {G}}=SGP\).</li>
        <li>Alice's private key is \((S,G,P)\) and her public key is \(({\hat {G}},t)\). Both are collections of
          matrices.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Encrypting plaintext</h3>
      <p>Say Alice's public key is \(({\hat {G}},t)\), and Bob wishes to send a message \(m\) to Alice:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Bob encodes the message \(m\) as a binary string of length \(k\).</li>
        <li>Bob computes the vector \(c^{\prime }=m{\hat {G}}\).</li>
        <li>Bob chooses a random \(n\)-bit vector \(z\) containing exactly \(t\) 1s.</li>
        <li>Bob generates the ciphertext \(c=c^{\prime }+z\).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Decrypting plaintext</h3>
      <p>When Alice receives \(c\), she decrypts the message like so:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Alice computes the inverse of \(P\) (i.e. \(P^{{-1}}\)).</li>
        <li>Alice computes \({\hat {c}}=cP^{-1}\)</li>
        <li>Alice uses the decoding algorithm for the code \(C\) to decode \({\hat {c}}\) to \({\hat {m}}\).</li>
        <li>Alice generates the original message \(m={\hat {m}}S^{-1}\).</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div>
    <br>
    <p>Another quantum-safe system is lattice-based cryptography. A lattice is a set of all integer linear combinations
      of basis vectors in \(\mathbb{R}^n\), i.e. a set of \(n\)-dimensional coordinates. Cracking lattice cryptography
      involves solving the Shortest Vector Problem within a massive lattice, i.e. finding the shortest distance from the
      origin to a particular point \(P\) on the lattice (mathematically expressed as \(\min_{\rm v \in L} ||v||\), where
      \(v\) is any vector travelling from the origin to \(P\)). This is an NP-hard problem, even with quantum computers
      involved, and therefore this is quantum-safe. NTRU is an extension to lattice-based cryptography, developed in
      1996, and it promises faster encryption and decryption than traditional public-key cryptography such as RSA.
      However since it is so new, it hasn’t been as thoroughly analysed against quantum attacks as other quantum-safe
      algorithms.</p>
    <p>There are many different reasons to pick each quantum-safe algorithm. Size of generated keys, speed of encryption
      and ease of verifiability are all factors to take into account.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; text-align: center">Advantages and disadvantages to various quantum-safe algorithms<sup>[4.6]</sup></p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <p>Unfortunately, many of these quantum-safe encryption methods are not currently in mainstream use. This is mainly
    due to key size; encryption methods such as the McEliece system usually have keys of more than a million bits,
    whereas RSA and ECC usually only have keys in the thousand bit range<sup>[4.3]</sup>. (Remember the keys for the
    McEliece system are a collection of large matrices, which could each easily have thousands of entries). The
    algorithms that have shorter keys also generally require more security analysis, and since quantum computers have
    not been made available to the general public, it is incredibly hard to verify whether these algorithms are indeed
    quantum-safe.</p>
  <p>Quantum-unsafe encryption standards such as RSA will eventually need to be replaced by quantum-safe methods, in
    case of hackers getting hands on quantum computing power. It may be hard to convince banks and governments to change
    their systems proactively, however this is necessary in order to avoid a surprise attack by hackers. Various startup
    security companies now actively focus on protecting against potential attacks from quantum computers; two such
    companies are ISARA in Ontario, Canada, and PostQuantum in London.</p>
  <p>ISARA’s flagship product, Radiate™, is advertised as a “high quality implementation...of quantum-safe algorithms
    and integration tools”<sup>[4.7]</sup>. Their system utilizes both the NTRU algorithm and the McEliece algorithm, as
    well as modified lattice-based encryption, and the company is currently in the process of getting their product
    certified as a cryptographic standard under the US government. ISARA is also involved in trying to create an
    international standard for quantum encryption, having recently submitted proposals to the widely used X.509
    encryption standard that support quantum-safe encryption certificates<sup>[4.8]</sup>.</p>
  <p>PostQuantum is a security company that specifically acts on blockchain technology to make it
    quantum-safe<sup>[4.9]</sup> (the cryptographic hashing system in the blockchain is based off of ECC, which as
    mentioned earlier is vulnerable to attacks using quantum computers). Their reasoning is much the same as for ISARA;
    they predict quantum computers will come into mainstream use within the next 10-20 years, and that current
    technology must be protected in advance in case of a surprise attack. The following is their predicted timeline for
    the quantum-computing industry:</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 0.4em; text-align: center">PostQuantum's predictions for the future of quantum computing<sup>[4.9]</sup></p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <div>
    <p>Even though quantum-safe algorithms may have drawbacks, it is important that research is focused on improving
      them and protecting them for the future. It is also essential that banks, governments and large companies start
      implementing quantum-safe encryption into their infrastructure, to protect against the day that malicious hackers
      get access to quantum computing power.</p>
