  <p style="margin-right: 400px">
    Coin flipping was introduced by Manuel Blum in 1981 as part of classical cryptography.
    Coin flipping is used when two parties do not trust each other (and there is not a reliable third party present to
    prevent cheating). E.g. Bob and Alice are divorced and live in different cities. They flip a coin over the phone
    to decide who will get the car. However, Bob is worried that if he tells Alice ‘heads’ say, Alice will lie and tell
    him he lost regardless of what the outcome of the coin flip actually is. Classical coin flipping is based on the
    assumption that completely secure one-way functions (‘an efficiently computable function … whose inverse cannot be
    computed efficiently’ and ‘from a knowledge of f(x) one cannot have more than a 50-50 change to guess efficiently if
    x has some non trivial property e.g. is even’ - Blum) exist. However, we do not know if they do, so currently we
    base it off normally secure one way functions/bit commitment schemes such as large prime factorisation which is used
    in current cryptographic systems (public/private key distribution) or cryptographic hashing. A commitment scheme
    allows you to commit to a chosen value whilst keeping it hidden from the other person. The value cannot be changed
    after it has been committed, but it can be shown when you desire. (with bit commitment schemes the committed value
    is a bit).
  </p>

  Method as presented by Blum in his paper<sup>[3.1]</sup>:
  <ol>
    <li> Alice and Bob agree on a completely secure one way function f.</li>
    <li> Alice selects an integer x unknown to Bob and sends him f(x).</li>
    <li> Bob guesses whether he thinks he is even or odd.</li>
    <li> Alice reveals whether he is wrong or right. She can send him the original x so that Bob can check using the
      function f whether Alice was lying or not.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p> In this way neither can cheat as Bob is just guessing as he cannot determine anything from f(x) and Alice cannot
    send Bob the wrong number as then when he computes f(the number) it would not produce the number she initially sent
    Bob in step 2). So replace the integer x and the properties even or odd with heads or tails. Alice flips the coin
    and sends Bob f(coin value). Bob guesses coin value and Alice reveals answer. Bob can check.</p>
  One method (from wikipedia):
  <ol>
    <li> Alice and Bob each choose a random string, "ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd" and "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd" respectively.</li>
    <li> Alice chooses an outcome for an imaginary coin flip, such as "tail".</li>
    <li> Bob sends Alice his random string "gfdgdfjkherfsfsd"</li>
    <li> Alice immediately computes a cryptographic hash of the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd gfdgdfjkherfsfsd", which
      is 59dea408d43183a3937957e71a4bcacc616d9cbc and sends it to Bob
    </li>
    <li> Alice asks Bob: "heads or tails"? Bob says, for instance, "heads".</li>
    <li> Alice tells him she's just won, and proves it by showing the string "tail ljngjkrjgnfdudiudd
      gfdgdfjkherfsfsd".
    </li>
    <li> Bob can check that Alice didn't lie by computing the SHA-1 of the string himself. Furthermore, Bob by providing
      his own randomly generated string guarantees that Alice wasn't able to precompute an image pair of "tail/random
      string" or "head/random string".
    </li>
  </ol>

    According to a research paper completed by C. Döscher and M. Keyl from the Braunschweig University of Technology,
    quantum mechanics does not provide a perfectly secure quantum coin tossing protocol, however,
    it does provide a significant security improvement over classical schemes<sup>[3.3]</sup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Method as presented in wikipedia<sup>[3.4]</sup>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Alice chooses a random basis e.g. horizontally or diagonally and a random sequence of bits.</li>
    <li> Alice encodes her qubits using her chosen basis and sends these qubits as a sequence of polarized photons to
      Bob.
    </li>
    <li> Bob chooses a basis at random for each of the photons and records the reading he gets based on the basis he
      chose.
    </li>
    <li> Based on his table, Bob makes a guess as to which basis Alice used to encode the photons.</li>
    <li> Alice can confirm whether Bob was correct or not by sending Bob her original un-encoded sequence along with the
      basis
      that she used. Bob can check that Alice has not cheated by comparing his table with a table created from encoding
      the qubits with Alice’s basis.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In principle, by classical theories of probability, “if we understood exactly which physical processes determine
    the outcome of the flip and also know with enough precision all of the relevant parameters”<sup>[3.5]</sup> e.g. air
    resistance or force acting on the
    coin, then we could predict the outcome of a coin flip with certainty. Two physicists, Andreas Albrecht and Daniel
    Phillips
    counter this idea and argue that quantum fluctuations could “entirely account for the outcome of these everyday
    macroscopic events”<sup>[3.5]</sup>.
    In fact, they claim that “all successful applications of probability to describe nature can be traced to quantum
    origins”<sup>[3.6]</sup> and
    that quantum uncertainty can completely randomize the coin flipping. In this way, Albrecht and Phillips argue that
    coin flipping
    can be seen as similar to Schrodinger’s cat, where the quantum object in this case is a coin and it’s state is
    simultaneously heads
    and tails until the coin is looked at, at which point the coin takes on a definite value of either heads or tails.
  </p>

    In 2014 scientists at a joint research lab between Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Télécom
    ParisTech
    experimentally implemented a quantum coin flipping protocol based on a practical plug and play system, which is an
    enhanced commercial quantum key distribution device. The researchers claim that their approach "performs strictly
    better
    than [a classical protocol] over a distance suitable for communication over metropolitan area optical networks"<sup>[3.7]</sup>.
    In their published research paper titiled "Experimental plug and play quantum coin flipping", the researchers stated
    that
    previous coin flipping protocols required either a single-photon source, which is highly difficult to produce, or an
    entangled
    source, which is difficult to implement over long distances, in order to be secure. Their protocol does not use
    entangled states,
    therefore making their implementation much more "easily implementable with standard photonic
    sources"<sup>[3.8]</sup>.
    Anna Pappa, one of the researchers involved in the aforementioned experiment states that since both Alice and Bob
    want to win,
    they both try to cheat by using methods such as "increasing the average photons contained in the pulses" or by
    "exploiting the physical
    properties of the system ... like in the detection of the different [quantum] states"<sup>[3.8]</sup>.</p>
