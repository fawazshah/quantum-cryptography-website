  <p style="margin-right: 320px">
    The concept of coin flipping was first introduced by Manuel Blum in 1981 as a classical cryptography primitive<sup>*</sup>.
    Coin flipping is used when two parties do not trust each other (and there is not a reliable third party present to prevent cheating).
    For example, Bob and Alice are divorced and live in different cities. They flip a coin over the phone to decide who will get the car. However,
    Bob is worried that if he tells Alice ‘heads’ say, Alice will lie and tell him that he lost regardless of what the outcome of the coin flip actually was.
    Classical coin flipping is based on the assumption that completely secure one-way functions exist. As described by Blum in his research paper <sup> [3.1] </sup>,
    such a function, f, should be "efficiently computable", have an inverse that cannot be computed easily, and "from a knowledge of f(x) one cannot
    have more than a 50-50 chance to guess efficiently if x has some non trivial property e.g. that it is even" <sup> [3.1] </sup>. Currently, however,
    we do not know if such a function exists and therefore, classical coin flipping is based off of normally, but not completely, secure one way
    functions or bit commitment schemes<sup>**</sup> such as large prime factorisation (which is still used in cryptographic systems today).
  </p>
  Method as presented by Blum in his paper<sup>[3.1]</sup>:
  <ol>
    <li> Alice and Bob agree on a completely secure one way function f.</li>
    <li> Alice selects an integer x unknown to Bob and sends him f(x).</li>
    <li> Bob guesses whether he thinks the original number x is even or odd.</li>
    <li> Alice reveals whether he is wrong or right. She can send him the original x so that Bob can check using the
      function f whether Alice was lying or not.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p> In this way neither Bob nor Alice can cheat: Bob is completely guessing as he cannot determine anything about x from f(x)
      and Alice cannot send Bob the wrong number y, say, because if Bob tries to compute f(y),
      the resulting value would not be the same as f(x), the number initially sent by Alice in step 2).
      So in terms of coin flipping, replace the integer x and the properties even or odd with heads or tails.
      Alice flips the coin and sends Bob f(coin value). Bob makes a guess and tells Alice what he thinks the coin value is.
      Alice then reveals the answer and Bob can check.</p>
  <p>
    (*) A cryptographic primitive is a well-established cryptographic algorithm that is used to build cryptosystems.
    All current classical cryptographic primitives are said to be computationally secure because they rely on
    the assumption that the computational function used is hard to reverse. Information theoretic security, which is stronger than computationally
    secure primitives, is "secure even against an all powerful cheating player, typically a player who can easily factor" <sup> [3.2] </sup>
    <br>
      (**) A bit commitment scheme, which is also a cryptographic primitive, allows Alice to commit to a chosen bit whilst keeping all information about it hidden from Bob.
      The bit cannot be changed after it has been committed, however, it can be revealed to Bob.

    According to a research paper completed by C. Döscher and M. Keyl from the Braunschweig University of Technology,
    quantum mechanics does not provide a perfectly secure quantum coin tossing protocol, however,
    it does provide a significant security improvement over classical schemes<sup>[3.3]</sup>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Method as presented in wikipedia<sup>[3.4]</sup>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Alice chooses a random basis e.g. horizontally or diagonally and a random sequence of bits.</li>
    <li> Alice encodes her qubits using her chosen basis and sends these qubits as a sequence of polarized photons to
         Bob. </li>
    <li> Bob chooses a basis at random for each of the photons and records the reading he gets based on the basis he
         chose. </li>
    <li> Based on his table, Bob makes a guess as to which basis Alice used to encode the photons.</li>
    <li> Alice can confirm whether Bob was correct or not by sending Bob her original un-encoded sequence along with the basis
         that she used. Bob can check that Alice has not cheated by comparing his table with a table created from encoding the
         qubits with Alice’s basis. </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    In principle, by classical theories of probability, “if we understood exactly which physical processes determine
    the outcome of the flip and also know with enough precision all of the relevant parameters” <sup>[3.5]</sup> e.g. air resistance or force acting on the
    coin, then we could predict the outcome of a coin flip with certainty. Two physicists, Andreas Albrecht and Daniel Phillips
    counter this idea and argue that quantum fluctuations could “entirely account for the outcome of these everyday macroscopic events” <sup>[3.5]</sup>.
    In fact, they claim that “all successful applications of probability to describe nature can be traced to quantum origins” <sup>[3.6]</sup> and
    that quantum uncertainty can completely randomize the coin flipping. In this way, Albrecht and Phillips argue that coin flipping
    can be seen as similar to Schrödinger’s cat, where the quantum object in this case is a coin and it’s state is simultaneously heads
    and tails until the coin is looked at, at which point the coin takes on a definite value of either heads or tails.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2014 scientists at a joint research lab between Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique and Télécom ParisTech
    experimentally implemented a quantum coin flipping protocol based on a practical plug and play system, which is an
    enhanced commercial quantum key distribution device. The researchers claim that their approach "performs strictly better
    than [a classical protocol] over a distance suitable for communication over metropolitan area optical networks" <sup>[3.7]</sup>.
    In their published research paper titiled "Experimental plug and play quantum coin flipping", the researchers stated that
    previous coin flipping protocols required either a single-photon source, which is highly difficult to produce, or an entangled
    source, which is difficult to implement over long distances, in order to be secure. Their protocol does not use entangled states,
    therefore making their implementation much more "easily implementable with standard photonic sources" <sup>[3.8]</sup>.
    Anna Pappa, one of the researchers involved in the aforementioned experiment states that since both Alice and Bob want to win,
    they both try to cheat by using methods such as "increasing the average photons contained in the pulses" or by "exploiting the physical
    properties of the system ... like in the detection of the different [quantum] states" <sup>[3.8]</sup>.
