  <h2>A Future with Quantum Cryptography</h2>
  <p>Although the theory discussed in other sections suggests quantum cryptography will greatly increase the security of
    systems, it might not be so simple in practice. Various factors will also affect the security of the systems, like
    machine <sup>[5.1]</sup> and human <sup>[5.2]</sup> error.</p>
  <p>“The security of Quantum Key Distribution systems is never absolute” <sup>[5.3]</sup>. The security of quantum key
    distribution (QKD) systems (and similar quantum cryptographical systems) relies on the following three assumptions
    <sup>[5.3]</sup>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Initial Secrecy of the Password</li>
    <li> Reliability of Devices in the System</li>
    <li> Correctness/Completeness of Quantum Theory</li>
  </ol>
  <p>This subtopic will explore the first and second assumptions, as the correctness/completeness of quantum theory is
    not so relevant to the discussion of cryptography, and is also beyond me by any means.</p>

  <div>
    <h2>Reliability of Devices</h2>

    <h3>Key Distribution</h3>
    <p>The common quantum key distribution methods rely on the ability to send a stream of single qubits to a receiver
      <sup>[5.4]</sup>. However, producing exactly one photon for each ‘bit’ of information has proven to be very
      difficult, as many
      methods of producing such a small amount of light, such as filtered lasers, have a chance of releasing multiple
      photons at the same time <sup>[5.4]</sup>. This brings a security flaw to QKD as it allows an outside eavesdropper
      to intercept
      the identical photons without the intended receiver being any the wiser; the receiver would still receive the same
      signal they’d expect as QKD methods work under the assumption that a single photon is always produced
      <sup>[5.5]</sup>. So, in
      the unlucky case that the final key has each ‘bit’ of information on two or more photons, the eavesdropper is also
      able to obtain the key and hence ‘listen in’ on the conversation.</p>
    <p>Methods of fighting the single photon flaws have been proposed. One method involves purposefully sending multiple
      photons at certain points to check if one gets stolen; if so, an eavesdropper has been identified. Another method
      involves changing the key distribution method, so both parties encode a key into a pair of photons that are
      entangled, so behave in the exact same way, even if they are separated by a large distance. If one of the
      entangled
      photons is intercepted, they interceptor would have no way of creating a copy photon to entangle with the senders
      kept photon, circumventing relying upon only one photon needing to be send at a time <sup>[5.5]</sup>.</p>

    <h3>Long Distance Signals</h3>
    <p>Communication between 2 computers sometimes requires the data sent and received to travel many miles by wire.
      This is currently a problem for data comprised of entangled photons; background radiation and noise from a
      “turbulent universe” can affect the photons and increase the error rates in detection of them <sup>[5.5]</sup>, as
      well as the
      chance of the photons not even reaching the endpoint due to the limited distance of fibre-based QKD
      <sup>[5.1]</sup>.</p>
    <p>Although signal repeaters could solve the distance problem, these would add weak points that could be exploited
      by a hacker. The repeaters would also be affected by background noise, and also the error rates of the machines
      correctness itself <sup>[5.6]</sup>. Over a long distance many repeaters would be needed, and the (small) errors
      in each
      repeater could potentially add up to a large inaccuracy in data transmission.</p>
    <p>It should also be noted that most quantum communications would need to be done via fibre optic cable (rather than
      free air) <sup>[5.7]</sup> from end to end <sup>[5.1]</sup>, which is not available for a lot of homes
      <sup>[5.8]</sup> <sup>[5.9]</sup>. And of the homes that do
      have fibre access, most of them have the last mile of cable made from copper wire instead <sup>[5.1]</sup>. This
      means the signal conversion from quantum to classical would have to be done at the endpoint of the fibre optic,
      not the endpoint of the entire communication system, so the last stretch of the cable can be intercepted via
      classical hacking methods, decreasing security of the system. Adding in how many rural homes use mobile or
      satellite broadband <sup>[5.9]</sup>, with current infrastructure, end-to-end quantum security won’t be available
      to most homes.</p>

    <h3>Attacking the Detectors</h3>
    <p>Another approach hackers might take against QKD is against the message receiver’s photon detectors. The detectors
      are designed to register the properties of each photons that passes through, but tests have shown that these
      detectors can be “blinded” by a strong pulse of light that stop them detecting a photon being received. It has
      been suggested the “blinding” technique can be used to “control” the detector <sup>[5.10]</sup>.</p>
    <p>This has led to the study of device-independent cryptography <sup>[5.11]</sup>, so that the only variables that
      the security
      depends upon are based only upon “directly observable correlations between sender and receiver, and it does not
      matter how these correlations have been established” <sup>[5.10]</sup>. This means that in the event of situations
      that put
      previous methods of quantum security at risk, like the detectors being blinded or multiple photons being produced
      at a time, a device-independent encryption system would not fail, as the sender and receiver still produce the
      right correlations, so algorithms would still be able to create a secret key from the communication
      <sup>[5.11]</sup>.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Initial Secrecy of the Password</h2>
    <p>It should be noted that most hacks (91%) are not performed by interception, instead the attacker will focus on
      the endpoints <sup>[5.2]</sup>. Various methods are employed by adversaries to gain sensitive information from
      users that don’t
      involve interception of signal, but they mainly have 2 ideas behind them; having malicious software on the user’s
      computer, or deception <sup>[5.12]</sup>.</p>

    <h3>Deception</h3>
    <p>With different methods of fooling a user, like phishing <sup>[5.13]</sup>, hackers can find out sensitive data,
      like passwords
      and emails, without having to really ‘hack’. Through social engineering, the hacker can gain the information by
      earning the users trust or giving them a false sense of security. If the hacker gains the user’s password, in the
      future, if a website use QKD, a hacker would be able to completely circumvent the security of the QKD system by
      just pretending to be the user (assuming the user would use the same password, as 55% <sup>[5.14]</sup>or more
      (81-87%) <sup>[5.15]</sup>
      indeed do); no need for interception.</p>

    <h3>Malicious Software</h3>
    <p>Various viruses and trojan horses can find their way onto a user’s computer, if the user is not careful. These
      can vary in impact; some just monitor the network, others will actively steal information, and some will attempt
      to delete and sabotage the computer. The malicious software can also find passwords and sensitive data that may
      have been sent or received on an encrypted network, again avoiding the need to intercept. Many users can
      unknowingly bring this software to corporate environments, and 60% are known to not care about corporate security
      when doing so<sup>[5.16]</sup>. A business could, in future, invest heavily into quantum security, but as 31%
      experience fraud
      directly from cybercrime<sup>[5.17]</sup>, and the stats seem to suggest that one of these attacks would not be
      via
      communications interception<sup>[5.18]</sup>, the quantum security would seem to be a lesser needed increase
      compared to
      better cyber security education for employees.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In a future world with quantum cryptography, we’d certainly expect cyber security for the average user to be
      stronger. But as the infrastructure doesn’t seem to be in place for now, and the hardware currently flaws the
      theoretical unbreak-ability of quantum cryptography, it will be a while before we can expect mainstream use.</p>
    <p>Even if we do overcome the problems in the hardware, and the encryption methods are perfected, this certainly
      won’t make any computer or business “un-hackable”, as most attacks appear to be from carelessness of the user. So
      maybe for networks where users are trusted to be careful and confidential, like in government, the quantum
      security would certainly play an important part in protecting the data. But for the average user, perhaps quantum
      cryptography should be nearer the back of the line of ways to improve our security.</p>
