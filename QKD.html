<h2>Key Distribution (Transferring keys safely) </h2>
	  <p><b>Entanglement based protocols </b>: The quantum states of multiple separate objects can become linked together in such a way that they must be described by a combined quantum state, not as individual objects (known as entanglement)  and performing a measurement on one object affects the other. [2.1] This property is used to guarantee a secure connection as intercepting either of the entangled pair of objects alters the overall system.</p>
	  <p><b>Prepare and measure protocols:</b> The security of the protocol comes from encoding the information in non-orthogonal states. Quantum indeterminacy means that both of these states cannot be measured without disturbing the original state; this property can be exploited to detect eavesdropping and to determine the amount of information that has been intercepted. </p>

	<h3>BB84 protocol: Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard (1984)</h3>
				
	  <p>This protocol was designed to use photon polarization states to transmit data, but works with any two pairs of conjugate states, e.g. many optical fibre based implementations use phase encoded states. </p>
	  <p>The sender (Alice) and the receiver (Bob) are connected by a quantum communication channel (such as an optical fibre or free space) and a public classical channel (broadcast radio or the internet).</p>
 
	<h3>Step 1 (Generation of photons/key)</h3> 
	  <p>Alice creates a random bit (0 or 1) and then randomly selects one of two bases (say vertical/	horizontal or diagonal) to transmit it in. She then prepares a photon polarization state depending both on the bit value and basis, as shown below:</p>

	<h3 style="margin-top=1em">Step 2 (Quantum transmission of photons/ key)</h3>

	<p>Alice then transmits a single photon in this state to Bob using the quantum channel. This process is repeated with new random bits, with Alice recording the state, basis and time of each photon sent.</p>


	<h3>Step 3 (Check validity of measurements)</h3>

	<p>As Bob does not know the basis the photons were encoded in, he selects a basis at random to measure in, for example using a horizontal/vertical polarizing filter.</p>
	<p>If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical then this measures the correct state, but if it was created as diagonal then there is a 50-50 chance of returning either horizontal or vertical. Bob also records the time, measurement basis used and measurement result of each photon received.[2.2]</p>
	<p>Bob and Alice then compare the basis in which Alice sent each photon with the basis Bob measured it in, discarding any which do not match to leave on average half the bits as a shared key.</p>


	<h3>Step 4 (Security/No cloning Theorem)</h3>

	<p>Alice and Bob then compare a predetermined subset of their remaining bit strings, aborting the key and trying again if over a certain number of bits differ,  possibly with a different quantum channel. </p>
	<p>An eavesdropper (Eve) must gain a copy of each photon for themself and pass an accurate copy on to Bob to avoid detection when Alice and Bob compare later. </p>
	<p> However, this is impossible as the no cloning theorem guarantees that if a cloning device can copy the vertical/horizontal polarizations, it will fail to copy either of the diagonal polarizations.[2.3] Hence, to eavesdrop, Eve must introduce errors in Bob’s measurements, and the key will be aborted. </p>
