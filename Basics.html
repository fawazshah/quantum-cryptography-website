    <h2>Basics for Quantum Cryptography </h2>
    <h3> Qubit (Quantum bit)</h3>
    <p> A qubit is an object which can attain a state of quantum superposition between two states, for example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> the up and down spin states of an electron</li>
      <li> the two orthogonal polarization states of a photon.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The state of a single qubit can be described by a two-dimensional column vector of complex numbers. The two
      states in which a qubit are measured are known as basis states, where any pair of vectors that are linearly
      independent could serve as a basis. These two quantum states correspond to the two states of a classical bit,
      namely 0 and 1. </p>
    <p>Any quantum state vector can be written as a sum of these basis vectors, where only two out of infinitely many
      vectors correspond to states of classical bits.</p>

    <h3> Uncertainty Principle </h3>
    <p> Measuring a qubit collapses the quantum state to either one of the two classical states 0 or 1, i.e. the state
      of the qubit becomes one of the two basis vectors. Hence, a qubit can be thought to represent both states
      simultaneously.</p>
    <p> One important aspect of the measurement process is that it alters the state of the quantum system: the effect of
      the measurement is that the new state is exactly the outcome of the measurement. </p>
    <p> Only a qubit which is already in a basis state (like a classical bit) will be left unchanged after the
      measurement. </p>

    <h3> No-Cloning Theorem </h3>
    <p>After the measurement, the system is in the measured state. That is, further measurements will always yield the
      same value. [1.3] </p>
    <p>As we can only extract one bit of information from the state of a qubit, it has been proved to be physically
      impossible to fully replicate the original qubit.[1.4] </p>

    <h3> Uses in Cryptography </h3>
    <p> Qubits can be used to transfer a key along a quantum communication channel. This key can then be used to encrypt
      data using a cipher, allowing data to be sent securely along classical channels of communication.</p>
